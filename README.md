## Getting Started

TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first fully autonomous Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform. It allows users to run both manual and automated testing of web and mobile apps across 3000+ different browsers, operating systems, and real device combinations.

If you want to verify file download in automation test in Mocha.js on TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest), you can follow the below steps. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Mocha-Selenium-sample).

- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).
- Follow the [TestMu AI Documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/) for the full setup walkthrough.

# Steps:


## Step 1: Add test case

You can use the following testcase (full test in `single_test.js`)

```js
it("can find search results", function(done) {
    driver.get("https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/").then(function() {
        driver.findElement(webdriver.By.xpath('/html/body/table/tbody/tr[]/td[2]/a')).click().then(function(){  
            if (driver.executeScript("lambda-file-exists=chromedriver_win32.zip")){
                driver.executeScript("lambda-status=passed");
            }
            else
            {
                driver.executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
            } 
        });
    });
  });
```

## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.

Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI

In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.

As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.

That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm. 

What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
